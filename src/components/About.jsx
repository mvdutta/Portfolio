                Hello, nice to meet you!
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm a software developer with a diverse background in biology,
                food-service management, and clinical dietetics. While working
                as a dietitian, I needed a nutrition calculator so I could spend
                less time performing calculations, and more time with patients.
                I couldn't find a suitable one, so I learned the basics of
                programming and built one myself! After that, I fell in love
                with programming and ultimately switched careers to become a
                software developer.
              </p>
              <p>
                I take pride in delivering high-quality solutions that meet the
                needs of users, whether it's creating intuitive user interfaces
                or building robust backend systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have any questions or if you're interested in
                collaborating, Iâ€™d love to hear from you!
              </p>
